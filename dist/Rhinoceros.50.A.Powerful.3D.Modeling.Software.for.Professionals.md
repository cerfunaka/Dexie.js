## How to create a 3D model of a car with Rhinoceros 5.0
 
One of the common applications of Rhinoceros 5.0 is to create 3D models of cars and other vehicles. You can use Rhinoceros 5.0 to design, prototype, and render realistic and detailed car models that can be used for animation, simulation, or presentation.
 
To create a 3D model of a car with Rhinoceros 5.0, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Start by sketching the outline of the car on a 2D plane. You can use the Curve command to draw the curves that define the shape of the car. You can also import an image of a car as a reference and trace over it.
2. Next, use the Surface command to create surfaces from the curves. You can use different types of surfaces, such as planar, extruded, lofted, swept, or revolved, depending on the shape of the car. You can also use the BlendSrf command to create smooth transitions between surfaces.
3. Then, use the Join command to join the surfaces into a solid object. You can also use the Trim command to cut off any unwanted parts of the surfaces. You can also use the FilletEdge command to round off the edges of the surfaces.
4. After that, use the Edit command to modify the shape of the car. You can use different tools, such as Move, Rotate, Scale, Gumball, CageEdit, or History, to adjust the position, orientation, size, or deformation of the car.
5. Finally, use the Render command to apply materials, textures, lights, and shadows to the car. You can choose from a variety of predefined materials and textures in Rhinoceros 5.0 or create your own custom ones. You can also adjust the settings of the lights and shadows to create different effects.
